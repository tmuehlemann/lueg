This is a personal project aimed at creating a web application to manage my media collection. The project primarily serves as a learning experience for utilizing SvelteKit and NestJS frameworks.

## Project status
I'm currently transitioning the backend to NestJS because I've encountered limitations in implementing certain features, such as Websockets and background tasks, using SvelteKit.

Things i want to change, during the transitioning:
- [ ] creating my own authentication system
  - [ ] passkeys support (maybe)
- [ ] Switching from mysql to postgres

## Technologies Used
- **SvelteKit:** Frontend framework for building reactive web applications. 
- **NestJS:** Backend framework for building efficient and scalable server-side applications.
